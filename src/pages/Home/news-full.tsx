        <p className="pb-[20px]">
          Every year on September 29, World Heart Day shines a spotlight on cardiovascular health. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death for men and women worldwide, claiming millions of lives annually. Yet the truth is: most heart conditions are preventable. At Euracare, we believe awareness, prevention, and access to expert care can save countless lives.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px]">Why Heart Health Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Your heart is an incredible organ, beating more than 100,000 times every day to keep you alive. Yet it‚Äôs also highly vulnerable to modern lifestyles. Stressful routines, poor diet, smoking, alcohol, and sedentary behavior all contribute to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These ‚Äúsilent risks‚Äù often go unnoticed until a major event like a heart attack or stroke occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Nigeria and across Africa, cardiovascular disease rates are rising sharply. Greater urbanization, dietary changes, and less physical activity have created the perfect storm for an increase in heart-related conditions. That‚Äôs why prevention and awareness are more important than ever.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Prevention Is Power</h3>
        <p>Small changes truly make a big difference. Eating more fruits and vegetables, walking 30 minutes a day, limiting salt and sugar, managing stress, and quitting smoking all significantly reduce your risk. Regular check-ups with a cardiologist also help detect problems early, before they become life-threatening.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Euracare‚Äôs Role in Heart Health</h3>
        <p>

          When people think about heart treatment, they often imagine open-heart surgery ‚Äî long hospital stays, big scars, and lengthy recovery. But medicine has changed dramatically. Today, interventional cardiology allows doctors to treat many heart conditions with minimally invasive procedures, using catheters and imaging guidance. At Euracare, this specialty is transforming lives.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px]">What Is Interventional Cardiology?</h3>
        <p>Interventional cardiology uses small incisions, usually in the wrist or groin, to insert a catheter into the blood vessels. Guided by real-time imaging, specialists can:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 space-y-[2px]">
          <li>Open blocked arteries with angioplasty</li>
          <li>Insert stents to keep arteries open</li>
          <li>Repair damaged heart structures</li>
          <li>Remove dangerous plaque build-up</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These procedures restore blood flow, relieve chest pain, and prevent heart attacks ‚Äî without the need for open surgery.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Benefits for Patients</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Less invasive:</span> No large cuts, fewer scars</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Lower risk:</span> Reduced chances of infection and complications</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Faster recovery:</span> Many patients return home within 24‚Äì48 hours</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Better outcomes:</span> Procedures are highly precise and effective</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px]">What Is Interventional Radiology?</h3>
        <p>IR uses imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT, and fluoroscopy to guide tiny instruments through the body. Through a small incision, specialists perform treatments that once required major surgery. Common uses include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li>Treating blocked arteries</li>
          <li>Stopping internal bleeding</li>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Why Patients Prefer IR</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li>Less pain: Minimal incisions mean minimal discomfort</li>
          <li>Shorter stays: Many patients go home the same day</li>

          <li>Quicker recovery: Return to normal life faster</li>

      <>
        <p className="lg:pb-[20px]">
          For many people, losing weight isn‚Äôt as simple as ‚Äúeat less and move more.‚Äù Obesity is a complex condition influenced by genetics, metabolism, environment, and emotional health. Beyond appearance, it carries serious risks: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, and even certain cancers. When lifestyle changes alone aren‚Äôt enough, bariatric surgery can provide a powerful tool for reclaiming health and quality of life.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px]">Understanding Bariatric Surgery</h3>
        <p>Bariatric surgery refers to a group of procedures designed to help patients achieve significant and sustained weight loss. These surgeries work by reducing the size of the stomach, limiting food intake, or changing how the digestive system absorbs nutrients. Importantly, they are not cosmetic procedures ‚Äî they are evidence-based medical interventions for people whose health is compromised by obesity.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Who Can Benefit?</h3>
        <p>Bariatric surgery is generally considered for people who:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li>Have a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher</li>
          <li>Have a BMI of 35 or higher with obesity-related health issues such as diabetes or high blood pressure</li>
          <li>Have tried diet and exercise without lasting success</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It‚Äôs not about taking the ‚Äúeasy way out.‚Äù In fact, bariatric surgery requires significant commitment to lifestyle changes, but it can open the door to possibilities that were previously out of reach.</p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Health Benefits Beyond Weight Loss</h3>
        <p>Research consistently shows that bariatric surgery offers life-changing benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Diabetes control:</span> Many patients see their blood sugar return to normal, sometimes within days of surgery</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Lower blood pressure and cholesterol:</span> These improvements reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Better sleep:</span> Conditions like sleep apnea often resolve, allowing for more restful nights</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Improved fertility:</span> Weight loss can restore hormonal balance and improve reproductive health</li>
          <li><span className="font-semibold">Greater mobility:</span> Less strain on joints makes everyday movement easier and less painful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For many, the benefits extend beyond physical health to mental wellbeing ‚Äî greater confidence, reduced stigma, and improved quality of life.        </p>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[20px] pt-[20px] lg:pt-[30px]">Euracare‚Äôs Holistic Approach</h3>
        <p>
          At Euracare, bariatric surgery is never ‚Äújust an operation.‚Äù We provide complete care through a multidisciplinary team including surgeons, dietitians, psychologists, and medical specialists.
